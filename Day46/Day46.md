## **What is a Cryptocurrency?**

A **cryptocurrency** or **crypto asset** is a type of digital currency that uses cryptographic techniques to provide a secure payment system. These encryption methods allow:

- Regulation of new currency issuance.
- Verification of fund transfers.
- Elimination of the need for a central bank or financial institution as an intermediary.

Cryptocurrencies do not exist in physical form, but they enable instant transactions over the Internet, regardless of borders.

## **The Origin of Cryptocurrencies**

Throughout history, various means of exchange have existed: barter, precious metals, paper money. However, in the digital era, a more modern and secure medium of exchange became necessary.

The concept of cryptocurrency dates back to the **cypherpunk** movement in the 1980s, where the use of cryptography was promoted to guarantee privacy and security in communications.

### Key Milestones

- **1990s**: David Chaum creates **Digicash**, a centralized electronic money system.  
- **1997**: Adam Back proposes **Hashcash**, a proof-of-work system to fight spam.  
- **2009**: **Bitcoin** is born — the first fully decentralized cryptocurrency, created by the mysterious **Satoshi Nakamoto**.

Other cryptocurrencies known as **altcoins** have emerged since, including:

- Namecoin (2011)  
- Litecoin (2011)  
- Peercoin (2012)

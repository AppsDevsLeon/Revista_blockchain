## Secure Storage

It is important to remember a very relevant point: it is estimated that 64% of **Bitcoins** worldwide have never been spent. Other studies show that only 78% of these Bitcoins were in circulation in 2012. Many of the **Bitcoins** generated back then are now lost in the digital garbage of the internet, with no possibility of recovery or resale. These funds have become true financial junk of the web.

There are many stories of users who, for various reasons, lost their private keys or seeds and now cannot access their wallets, where they stored large amounts of cryptocurrencies. A well-known example is that of an Australian who accidentally threw away a hard drive containing **1400 Bitcoins**, thinking they would never have value.

**What does this mean?** There are hundreds of cases of people who lost access to their funds because they didn’t have an adequate security strategy. Today, **1400 Bitcoins** are worth a significant amount of money, so it is essential that the storage of your private keys and seeds is safe and reliable.

## Types of Storage

There are two types of storage: **cold storage** and **regular storage**.

### Cold Storage

Cold storage is the safest and is used for wallets that are not continuously used. 

1. **HSM (Hardware Security Module)**: This is a highly secure hardware space where you can store sensitive information. In our case, it would be ideal for storing your private keys and seeds. It is the safest option but also the most expensive.
   
2. **Paper**: Storing your keys on paper is very safe, as anything stored on a computer can be stolen. However, paper has its downside: it can deteriorate over time. Therefore, it is important to be careful with the type of paper and ink you use.

3. **Hardware Devices**: There are numerous hardware products available that allow you to store your private keys securely. However, these solutions often come from small or unverified companies, so it is important to exercise caution and choose the right solution.

### Regular Storage

While cold storage is the safest option, there are more accessible solutions you may also consider:

1. **Cloud**: For example, storing your keys in a Google Docs document. While convenient, it is not the safest option as cloud services come with risks. It is crucial to carefully review which platform you store your keys on and ensure you have full control over your credentials.

2. **Digital Devices**: Storing keys on a computer, website, or smartphone has many vulnerabilities. The weakest link is always the user, so storing sensitive keys on these devices is not recommended.

## Security Tips

1. **Be cautious with online services**: As we’ve mentioned, storing your keys in the cloud, on a website, or on a mobile phone comes with risks. There is always the possibility that a malicious agent will try to access your data.

2. **Wallets for small amounts**: If you perform daily operations or frequent transfers, I recommend using different wallets to manage small amounts of cryptocurrencies. After performing transactions, you can stop using that wallet.

3. **Backup your wallet**: Always back up your wallet. It is advisable to use one of the secure storage methods mentioned earlier, such as cold storage or encryption.

4. **Encryption**: If you decide to store your keys on a digital device, it is highly recommended to encrypt them. There are multiple encryption solutions that will ensure the security of your wallet.

5. **Cold Wallets for large amounts**: If you have a large amount of cryptocurrencies, it is vital to use a cold wallet. Cold wallets are more secure and designed to protect large amounts of assets.

6. **Always keep software updated**: Ensure that all the software on your computer is up to date. Malicious agents try to exploit any vulnerabilities in the system, so always ensure you have the latest versions of your programs.

7. **Multisignature**: A great security practice is to use multisignature for your main wallet. This means that not only will you need one private key to access your funds, but multiple, which enhances the security of your assets.

With these tips, you should have a better idea of how to secure your wallets and protect your cryptocurrencies. Remember, **security is crucial** to keeping your assets safe from malicious attacks.

## **What are Hardware Wallets?**

The security of our cryptocurrency funds is not something to be taken lightly. That is why **hardware wallets** were created. These are physical devices designed to provide the highest level of security for our funds at all times.

When considering the security and protection of our cryptocurrencies, hardware wallets present themselves as one of the most reliable options. These small devices allow us to store and protect our private keys in a physical device specifically designed for this purpose.

In this article, we will provide a comprehensive explanation of what hardware wallets are, how they work, which ones are available on the market, their features, and some usage recommendations to get the most out of them.

## What are Hardware Wallets?

**Hardware wallets** are physical devices that operate as offline wallets and keep private keys securely stored within them. They are part of the **Cold Wallets** category due to their cold storage, as they are not connected to the blockchain or the internet.

These devices are specifically designed for this purpose, being small **HSM (Hardware Security Modules)** with military-grade security. They allow for the generation of private keys and ensure that these keys never leave the device. Moreover, if the device is physically tampered with to access the private keys, it "self-destructs," completely erasing the keys.

They represent one of the safest and most convenient options on the market for storing large amounts of cryptocurrencies offline, as they protect private keys within the device itself, but can be comfortably used, usually via USB. Most use a security chip where the keys are retained, and they can never be transferred outside the device.

## Functions of Hardware Wallets

**Hardware wallets** have two main functions:

1. **Generate private keys.**
2. **Sign content that is sent to them using those keys.**

In this way, the private key never leaves the device, not even for a second. Most hardware wallets have a screen so that the user can verify what they are authorizing to sign, helping prevent hacks through transaction interception.

They are compact and portable devices, allowing them to be taken anywhere or kept safe in a secure place. To manage your cryptocurrencies, you only need to connect them to a computer or smartphone via a USB port, enter your password, and make the transactions. The device automatically shuts off when the wallet is disconnected.

The level of security they offer is extremely high and reliable, as the validation process for operations occurs inside the device, not on the computer or smartphone to which it is connected.

## Features of Hardware Wallets

- **Immune to viruses and malware:** They are resistant to virus and malware attacks that can infect devices and steal private keys.
- **Full control:** The user has full control over the private keys and, therefore, over the funds.
- **Random key generation:** Private keys are generated randomly and without patterns using a **Random Number Generator (RNG)**.
- **Limited communication media:** Hardware wallets seek to maximize security through limited communication channels.
- **Open-source code:** The software of most hardware wallets is open-source, allowing users and the community to verify the security processes implemented.
- **Additional security layers:** They can incorporate measures such as a PIN set by the user or two-factor authentication (**2FA**) to protect the device in case of theft or loss.
- **Compatibility with operating systems:** They are compatible with most available operating systems.
- **Key recovery:** They have a recovery seed that allows you to restore the keys and recover your funds.
- **Initial investment:** Devices range between €50 and €200, a small investment considering the security they provide.

## Usage Recommendations for Hardware Wallets

1. **Backup the seed:** When setting up a hardware wallet for the first time, it is advisable to write down a backup of the seed or recovery words. Some wallets only show the seed once.
2. **Store the seed securely:** Keep the backup of the seed in a safe place. If it gets damaged or lost, it will be impossible to restore the wallet and recover the funds.
3. **Encrypt backups:** Never back up the seed on a device without encrypting it first, as these are vulnerable to hacks.
4. **Buy from official providers:** Make sure to purchase the hardware wallet from official providers and not from third-party or unofficial markets to avoid the risks of hacking and scams.

## Examples of Hardware Wallets

Several brands are available on the market, but three leading companies offer reliable and secure hardware wallets:

### **Trezor**
Trezor was one of the first companies to develop hardware wallets. Trezor wallets are well-known for their high security and ease of use. They are deterministic **(HD)** wallets, meaning they can generate an unlimited number of addresses from a single seed.

**Models:**
- **Trezor One** and **Trezor T**  
Both devices are compatible with Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS. They offer an isolated environment for signing transactions, significantly reducing the chance of private keys being exposed.

- **Trezor Safe 3** and **Trezor Safe 5**  
More recent models offering enhanced security features with advanced encryption technology and support for a larger number of cryptocurrencies. The **Trezor Safe 3** is ideal for those seeking a more affordable option without sacrificing security. The **Trezor Safe 5** is a premium option that includes additional security features, such as enhanced recovery options and an improved interface.

### **Ledger**
Ledger offers a variety of hardware wallets, such as the **Ledger Nano S** and **Ledger Nano X**. They use an operating system called **BOLOS** on a secure chip that allows open-source applications to run in complete isolation.

**Models:**
- **Ledger Nano S** and **Ledger Nano X**  
These are small devices that connect via USB and can manage up to 22 cryptocurrencies and more than 1250 ERC20 tokens.

### **KeepKey**
KeepKey is another USB device for storing cryptocurrencies. It offers high levels of security and generates a 12-word recovery seed. It supports more than 40 cryptocurrencies and requires the **KeepKey Chrome** app to operate.

Hardware wallets are an excellent option for securely storing large amounts of cryptocurrencies. With their high level of security, ease of use, and resistance to attacks, these wallets offer a reliable solution to protect your digital assets. Don't hesitate to invest in a hardware wallet if you want to keep your funds safe and out of the reach of potential hackers.

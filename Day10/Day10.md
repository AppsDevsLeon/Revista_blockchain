## **2. Fundamental Concepts of Blockchain**

### 2.1 What is a Block?

- **Definition:**  
  A block is a digital file that stores relevant information, such as transactions, timestamps, and other metadata.

- **Components of a Block:**

  - **Block Hash:**  
    A unique value generated by a hash function (for example, SHA-256) that immutably identifies the block's content.
  
  - **Previous Block Hash:**  
    Each block contains the hash of the previous block, creating a sequential link and ensuring the integrity of the entire chain.
  
  - **Nonce:**  
    A number that miners must find to meet the difficulty criteria in the mining process.
  
  - **List of Transactions:**  
    A record of all transactions or data intended to be stored in the block.

### 2.2 The Blockchain

- **Chained Structure:**  
  By including the previous block's hash, each block connects to the next, forming an unbroken chain that traces back to the genesis block. This ensures that any alteration in a block would change its hash, breaking the sequence and revealing the manipulation.

  The image below illustrates this structure, showing how each block contains the hash of the previous one, ensuring continuity and integrity of the chain:

- **Immutability:**  
  Each block in the blockchain has a unique hash that represents it, along with a field that stores the previous block's hash. If someone tries to modify a block, its hash will change, invalidating all subsequent blocks.

1. **Genesis Block:**
   - Represents the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain.
   - Contains a hidden message in its coinbase transaction: *"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"*, a reference to the 2008 financial crisis.
   - Its previous hash is a sequence of zeros because there are no preceding blocks.

2. **Subsequent Blocks:**
   - Each block contains its own hash and the previous block's hash.
   - Any alteration in a block would change its hash, invalidating the blockchain.

3. **Security Chain:**
   - The use of hashes guarantees the integrity of the information.
   - The relationship between blocks means that any attempt at manipulation is immediately detectable.

4. **Immutable Ledger:**
   - If an attacker tries to modify a block, the change in the hash propagates to all subsequent blocks.
   - This property protects the blockchain against alterations and fraud.

The image below illustrates this principle of immutability:

## **3. Cryptographic and Mathematical Fundamentals**

### 3.1 Hash Functions

- **Key Properties:**

  - **Determinism:** A given input always produces the same hash.
  - **Change Sensitivity:** A minimal change in the input produces a completely different hash.
  - **Collision Resistance:** It is extremely unlikely that two different inputs produce the same hash.
  - **Preimage Resistance:** It is practically impossible to retrieve the original message from a hash.

- **Example: SHA-256:**  
  This algorithm takes any input data and transforms it into a 256-bit string, ensuring that each block has a unique "digital fingerprint."

### 3.2 Public and Private Key Cryptography

- **Basic Concept:**  
  Each user possesses a pair of keys: one public, which is shared openly, and one private, which is kept secret.
  
- **Applications:**
  - **Digital Signatures:** Ensure that transactions are authorized only by the owner of the private key.
  - **Encryption:** Protects information by ensuring that only the designated recipient can decrypt it.

### 3.3 Data Integrity

- **Immutable Chain:**  
  Each block contains the hash of the previous block, meaning that modifying one block would alter the entire subsequent chain, making any tampering evident.

- **Collective Verification:**  
  All nodes in the network verify the validity of each new block, reinforcing immutability and trust in the system.

### 3.4 Fraud Prevention

- **Distributed Consensus:**  
  The requirement that the majority of the network validates a block prevents a malicious actor from altering the information undetected.

- **Advanced Cryptography:**  
  The use of digital signatures and hash functions ensures that only legitimate owners can authorize transactions, eliminating the risk of forgery.

### 3.5 Decentralized Replication

- **Distributed Network:**  
  Each node in the network holds a complete copy of the blockchain, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure and making any attempt to manipulate information extremely difficult.

## **4. Decentralization and Consensus**

### 4.1 Decentralized Networks

- **Distributed Architecture:**  
  Instead of a single central server, the blockchain operates through a network of interconnected nodes, each with a complete copy of the chain.
  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Increased resilience to failures.
  - Reduced risk of censorship or centralized manipulation.

### 4.2 Consensus Algorithms

- **Proof of Work (PoW):**  
  - **Process:** Miners compete to solve a mathematical problem by finding the correct nonce that generates a hash meeting the difficulty requirements.
  - **Impact:** Enhances security by requiring significant computational effort.
  
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):**  
  - **Concept:** Validators are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, reducing the need for high energy consumption.
  
- **Other Algorithms:**  
  Methods like Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance mechanisms are also used to improve network efficiency and security.

## **5. The Mining Process in Detail**

### 5.1 What is Mining?

- **Definition:**  
  Mining is the process by which new blocks are validated and added to the blockchain, ensuring the integrity of the record.
  
- **Objective:**  
  To find the correct nonce which, when combined with the block's content, produces a hash that meets pre-established difficulty criteria.

### 5.2 Stages of the Mining Process

1. **New Block Notification:**  
   When a block is ready for validation, a signal is sent to the network so that miners can start searching for the nonce.
   
2. **Nonce Searching:**  
   Miners test millions of nonce combinations until one is found that produces a hash meeting the requirements (for example, a hash that starts with a series of zeros).
   
3. **Block Verification:**  
   Once the correct nonce is found, the block is broadcast to the network. Nodes then verify that both the hash and nonce are valid.
   
4. **Addition to the Blockchain and Reward:**  
   If the majority of nodes approve the block, it is added to the chain and the miner who found the nonce receives a reward in cryptocurrency. This reward is periodically halved to control the issuance of new tokens.

### 5.3 Difficulty Adjustment

- **Purpose:**  
  The system automatically adjusts the difficulty of the mathematical problem to maintain a constant average time between the generation of new blocks (for example, 10 minutes in Bitcoin).
  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Prevents network saturation.
  - Enhances security by increasing the computational barrier against potential attacks.

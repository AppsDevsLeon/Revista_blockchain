# Blockchain

## Bitcoin

`Bitcoin` was one of the first protocols to use this revolutionary technology called "blockchain". Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin's white paper, and it outlined how bitcoin can be used to make peer-to-peer transactions in a decentralized network. This network is powered by `cryptography`. It allows people to engage in censorship-resistant finance in a decentralized manner. Because of some of bitcoin's characteristics, many people regard it as a superior store of value to other assets such as gold. That's why it is commonly referred to as "digital gold." Similar to gold, there's a scarce and set amount of it on the planet, and people use it to buy and sell, similar to other assets. You can read more about the original vision in the [white paper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/).

## Ethereum

Some people saw this technology and thought that they could do even more. A few years later, a man named `Vitalik Buterin` released a white paper describing a new protocol called Ethereum, which used the same blockchain infrastructure but with an additional feature. In 2015, they released this project called `Ethereum`. He and several other co-founders took this blockchain technology and applied it in ways that allowed people to make entirely decentralized applications, decentralized organizations, build smart contracts, and engage in agreements without a third-party intermediary or centralized governing force. Their idea was to take the same pieces that made bitcoin great and add smart contracts to them. Technically, this was not even a new idea. Back in 1994, a man named Nick Szabo proposed a technology called `Smart Contracts`.

## Smart Contracts

A Smart Contract is a self-executing set of instructions that is executed without a third-party intermediary. They come to life on a blockchain, and these smart contracts are really going to be a core thing that we're going to be working with and we're going to be developing. Smart contracts are similar to regular traditional contracts that people make between each other, but instead of writing these contracts down on pen and paper or typing them on the computer, they're entirely written in code. The terms of the agreement are written in code and automatically executed by the decentralized blockchain network. These are the main differentiators between the Ethereum protocol and the Bitcoin protocol.

## Bitcoin Vs Ethereum

Technically, Bitcoin also has smart contracts; however, they're not `Turing Complete`: they don't have the full range of capabilities as a Turing-complete application like Ethereum. This is actually an intentional move by the Bitcoin developers. They view the bitcoin network as an asset, whereas the Ethereum and Ethereum developers view that asset as an asset and also a utility for people to build these smart contracts. These smart contracts are revolutionary technologies, but they actually come with a fatal flaw with what's known as `The Oracle Problem`.

## Oracle Problem & Solution

These blockchains are deterministic systems, and we'll learn very soon. This determinism means they are a walled garden, meaning that everything that happens in these smart contracts and on this blockchain happens in this little box. Now, of course, if you want these smart contracts to actually be these digital superior agreements, then they need to interact with the real world and get real data and external outside the blockchain computation. This is where `oracles` come into play. Oracles are the devices that bring data into a blockchain or execute some type of external computation.

## Hybrid Smart Contracts

Combining on-chain logic settlement layers with this off-chain data and external computation builds what are called `Hybrid Smart Contracts`. A large majority of `defi applications` in the largest applications today are these hybrid smart contracts. This is where the protocol `Chainlink` comes into play.

## Chainlink

`Chainlink` is a decentralized modular oracle network that allows you to bring data into your smart contracts and do external computation. These hybrid smart contracts can have this on-chain settlement and interact with the real world in some meaningful way. Chainlink is an incredibly powerful oracle network because it allows us to get data, get randomness, do some type of update or really customize our smart contracts in any way we want and elevate them to do anything that we want them to do.

## Importance of Ethereum

A decentralized application is usually a combination of several smart contracts. Smart contracts are going to be what we code, write, and deploy for the majority of this lesson. The Ethereum protocol has given rise to many new paradigms and industries, including `DEFI`, `NFTs`, `DAOs` (decentralized autonomous organizations), `Layer2`, and more.

## Summary

- Bitcoin was the first one to take blockchain mainstream.
- Bitcoin is like digital gold.
- Ethereum allows for smart contracts.
- Chainlink provides data and external computation to smart contracts.
- Hybrid smart contracts combine on-chain and off-chain computations.

## Blockchain and Smart Contract Features

### Decentralized

There's no centralized source that controls the blockchain. The individuals that make up the blockchain are known as `node operators`. They are the independent individuals running the software that connects the whole blockchain.

### Transparency & Flexibility

Everything that's done on blockchain and all the rules that are made can be seen by everyone. There are no backdoor deals, no shady happenings.

### Speed and Efficiency

Blockchains are verified by a decentralized collective, the settlement or withdrawal period, in this case, is substantially faster and, depending on the blockchain that you're using, can be anywhere from 10 minutes down to just a couple of seconds.

### Security and Immutability

Because blockchains are `immutable` which means they can't be changed, and because of this, they can't be tampered with or corrupted in any way, shape, or form.

### Removal of Counterparty Risk

Smart contracts, in particular, remove a massive conflict of interest.

## DAOs

`DAOs` are organizations that live online and in smart contracts. They're similar to regular organizations in the traditional world, but they have people who may hold governance tokens to make voting decisions or they may do all the governance on-chain on this decentralized settlement layer.

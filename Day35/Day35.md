## **What is a Wallet?**

In the world of cryptocurrencies, it's common to encounter different terms that refer to the same thing: **wallet**, **purse**, or **billfold**. Although the name may vary depending on the language or region, all refer to the same fundamental element in the crypto ecosystem.

The first thing we need to understand is that **cryptocurrencies are not stored like physical money**, unlike a traditional wallet.

## **What Does a Wallet Do?**

A wallet should not be thought of as a physical object where you store bills or coins. In reality, **cryptocurrencies are not stored inside the wallet**, because they **never leave the blockchain**. What the wallet really does is manage **access** and **control** over the funds that always remain on the network.

## **Cryptocurrencies and Their Blockchain**

Each cryptocurrency exists exclusively within its own network:

- **Bitcoin** only exists on the Bitcoin network.  
- **Ether (ETH)** only exists on the Ethereum network.

Itâ€™s possible to find tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum on other blockchains (such as Solana or Binance Smart Chain), but these are not the original assets. Instead, they are **wrapped or represented versions**, like **Wrapped Ether (WETH)** or **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)**.

## **Sending and Receiving Cryptocurrencies**

Your wallet connects to the blockchain to **send and receive funds**. The blockchain functions like a **distributed digital ledger**, where each transaction is publicly recorded:

> Juan sends 1 BTC to Ana  
> âœ… The network validates the transaction  
> ðŸ“ˆ Ana receives 1 BTC, and Juanâ€™s balance is reduced

Depending on the network, transactions are validated using different consensus mechanisms:

- **Proof of Work (PoW)** â€“ Used by Bitcoin  
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)** â€“ Used by Ethereum and other modern networks

## **The Private Key**

To authorize any transaction, a **private key** is required:

- Itâ€™s a long string of alphanumeric characters  
- It acts as a **secret password**  
- **It should never be shared or lost**  
- Whoever has access to the private key controls the associated funds

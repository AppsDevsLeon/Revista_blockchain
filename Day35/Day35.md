## **What is a Wallet?**

As you can see right below the title, first of all, a wallet, a purse, a billfold—or however it's said in your language—is all the same thing.

It all refers to the same concept. If you're starting from scratch, reading "wallet," "purse," or "billfold" might be confusing, but they all mean the same thing.

The first thing we need to understand is that cryptocurrencies are **not** stored like cash or water, unlike a conventional wallet.

I have mine here somewhere—but okay, here’s an image showing a wallet with some bills, some euros.

That’s not how it really works. Sure, there are some cold wallets that may **look** like that, but most don’t work that way.

In crypto, coins never leave the blockchain.

Cryptocurrencies—especially those in hot wallets—are always connected to the blockchain and **never** get disconnected from it.

Crypto only exists on its respective blockchain. That’s another key thing to understand.

For example: **Ether only exists on the Ethereum network.** It doesn't exist on the Bitcoin network, just like **Bitcoin only exists on the Bitcoin network.**

You might have seen tokens like “Bitcoin” or “Ether” on the Solana network or Binance chain.

But that’s not the real thing—it’s **not 100% the same**. What’s being used there is a **wrapped token**, a version that **mirrors** the original asset from another blockchain.

For example, Ether on another chain might be called **Wrapped Ether (WETH)**.

It’s basically a way to **interconnect blockchains** and let users move value across different ecosystems.

Anyway, I’m rambling a bit—let’s get back on track.

Your wallet connects to the blockchain to **send and receive cryptocurrencies**.

Now, the blockchain—if you’ve never heard of it—just imagine it like a **big ledger**, a massive database.

It records things like: *“Pepito sends Marina 1 Bitcoin.”* The blockchain logs that transaction, and then the miners **approve** it.

After that, the transfer is confirmed: Marina’s balance increases by 1 BTC, and Pepito’s goes down by 1 BTC.

That’s how the blockchain works.

Explained for **total beginners**, so we don’t get too technical.

As we said, a transaction must be approved, and to approve it—via miners and all that—well, that’s part of how the blockchain works. In Bitcoin’s case, it’s the **proof of work** mechanism.

But there are **other blockchains** that use **proof of stake**, which works a little differently.

Still, at the end of the day, a **blockchain is a giant ledger**, and that’s the key idea.

To **approve** a transaction, you need to use your **private key**, which only you know.

The private key (as we’ll see in the next slide) is a very long string of numbers and letters—basically your **password**.

And as you can imagine, looking at this example in the video, on the left you’ll see a bunch of random letters, words, upper/lowercase, numbers...

That’s the private key.

Let’s be honest—you’re not going to memorize that, even if you write it down.

It’s likely **more than 100 characters long**. So no, you’re not going to be copy-pasting that by hand all the time.

Let’s move on.

**Whoever has the private key has access to your crypto.** Simple as that.

The private key is like your **bank password**.

Then there's another concept: your **wallet address**.

Let’s say this is your wallet address. To better understand it, just think of it as a **bank account number**.

It’s similar to what you have with your bank card or savings account.

That’s the **address** you give people when you want them to send you money.

It’s also the address you use when sending funds from an exchange to your wallet—or wallet to wallet.

And here’s something important: **your wallet address is generated from your private key**.

That’s what I almost forgot to mention!

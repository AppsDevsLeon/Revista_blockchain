##  **Key Characteristics of Blockchain Structures **

### Linear Chain (Classic Blockchain)
- Secure block linking using cryptographic hashes
- High security, simple verification
- Potential issues with scalability and transaction speed

**Examples:** Bitcoin, Litecoin, Cardano

##  **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) **

- Blocks or transactions linked in a graph rather than a linear chain.
- Higher scalability and faster transactions.
- Reduced or eliminated dependency on miners.

**Examples:** IOTA, Avalanche, Hedera Hashgraph

##  **Merkle Trees **

- Allow quick verification of transaction integrity.
- Significantly reduce storage needs through hashing.

**Commonly Used in:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano

## Proof of History (PoH)

- Creates chronological order through cryptographic timestamps.
- Enables extremely fast validation of transactions.

**Example:** Solana

## **The Use of MemPool in the Blockchain Mining Process**

Now, let's continue with mining by exploring a key concept: **memory**, specifically **MemPool**. Why is it important? Because participants in the Bitcoin network are constantly making transactions with each other. These transactions are not immediately confirmed but must wait to be included in the next block. However, a new block is only added every **10 minutes** in Bitcoin.

### **What Happens to Transactions Before a New Block?**

Before a transaction is added to a block, it is stored in a "trial area" called **MemPool**. This area holds Bitcoin transactions that are not yet in a block and are waiting to be added to the next block when it is mined.

The **block size** is limited on the Bitcoin network, with a maximum of **2 megabytes (MB)**. This means that not all transactions in the MemPool can fit into a new block. Miners must select which transactions to include. Additionally, miners have control over which transactions they select, affecting the block's hash calculation.

## **The Block Size and Selection of Transactions**

In the Bitcoin network, the block size is limited to **2 MB**, but not all transactions from MemPool can be included in the new block. Miners must choose which transactions to include based on the available space and the **transaction fee** each one offers.

### **How Do Miners Choose Transactions?**

Miners can choose which transactions to include in the next block. This gives them control over which transactions are confirmed first. They may choose transactions with higher **transaction fees** to maximize their earnings.

## **Variability and the Influence of Transactions**

Each transaction added to MemPool affects the **hash** calculation of the block. If a miner decides to change a transaction or reconfigure the selected transactions, this will change the hash result, introducing **variability** into the mining process.

### **Illustrative Example of Transaction Selection**

1. **Start of the Process:**
   - A miner selects transactions pending in MemPool.
   - The transaction of **Johanna to James (2 BTC)** and **James to Johanna (5 BTC)** are chosen.

2. **Hash Calculation:**
   - These transactions are combined with other elements of the block, such as the block number and the **previous hash**.
   - A unique hash is calculated for the block.

3. **Change of Transactions:**
   - If the miner is unsuccessful in finding a valid hash after trying all possible nonce values, they can alter the selected transactions.
   - Changing the transactions will change the hash, restarting the process.

4. **Resetting the Process:**
   - By modifying the transactions, the miner can restart the mining process without waiting, allowing them to test new combinations until a valid hash is found.

## **Block Explorer and MemPool**

In the block explorer, we can see how transactions are organized and stored in MemPool before being added to a block. In a mined block, the transactions are shown along with the **block size** and the number of transactions included.

### **Example in the Explorer:**

1. **Block Size:**
   - A block can be up to 2 MB in size, but not all blocks are full of transactions. For example, a block might have only **800 transactions** out of a possible **1560**.

2. **Viewing in the Explorer:**
   - The explorer also shows the **transactions pending in MemPool**, as well as the **mining rate** and **difficulty** of the network.

## **Importance of MemPool for Industrial Miners**

**Industrial miners** and **mining pools** have a great advantage due to their ability to perform millions of calculations per second. Through MemPool, they can **test different transaction configurations** continuously without downtime.

### **No Waiting Time:**

- Industrial miners can modify MemPool as they please to **reset the calculation process** without waiting, allowing them to continue testing combinations and increase their chances of finding a valid hash in less time.

## **The Role of MemPool in Blockchain Mining**

MemPool is essential in the Bitcoin mining process. It organizes the transactions that have not yet been confirmed and prepares them for the next mined block. Furthermore, it gives miners the ability to **modify transactions** and restart the mining process, improving efficiency in the search for a valid hash.

This system of **variability** and the ability to change transactions is crucial for maintaining **competition** among miners and ensuring that blocks are mined effectively and continuously.

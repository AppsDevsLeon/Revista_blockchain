## **Cryptocurrency Mining: Process, Purpose, and Technology**

**Cryptocurrency mining** is the process by which new transactions are validated and recorded on a blockchain. It involves solving complex cryptographic problems to add valid blocks to the blockchain. The participants who perform this work are called **miners**.

---

## **Purpose of Mining**

1. **Transaction validation**: Ensuring transactions are legitimate.  
2. **Network security**: Increasing resistance to attacks (like double spending).  
3. **Issuance of new coins**: In networks like Bitcoin, mining is the only way to generate new units of the cryptocurrency.  
4. **Decentralized consensus**: Achieving agreement without a central authority, using algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW).

## **How Does It Work?**

### 1. Transaction Grouping  
Miners collect pending transactions and group them into a block.

### 2. Hash Calculation  
They use algorithms such as **SHA-256** to calculate the hash of the new block, including:  
- Hash of the previous block  
- List of transactions  
- An adjustable value called a **nonce**

### 3. Difficulty Target  
The resulting hash must meet a specific condition (e.g., start with several zeros). This target is automatically adjusted to maintain a steady block generation rate.

### 4. Competition  
Thousands of miners test different nonces until a valid hash is found. The first to do so **wins the block reward**.

### 5. Propagation and Verification  
The block is sent to the network to be verified by other nodes. If the majority approves, it is added to the blockchain.

## **Consensus Protocol: Proof of Work (PoW)**

Mining is commonly based on the **Proof of Work** algorithm, which requires proving that computational power was spent to solve the problem.

Key characteristics:
- Energy and resource intensive  
- Hard to solve, but easy to verify  
- Protects against tampering and Sybil attacks

The image below shows the structure of a blockchain block, specifically block #3, which contains key information such as:

- **Block number**: Indicates its position in the chain.  
- **Nonce**: A field that is currently empty, but is used in mining to find a valid hash.  
- **Transaction data**: Records the transactions in this block, including transfers of "jbcoins" between users.  
- **Prev. Hash**: The hash of the previous block, which ensures continuity and integrity of the chain.  
- **Hash**: The unique digital fingerprint of the block, generated from all the block's information.

In this image, it appears that the block has not yet been mined, as the Nonce field is empty.

The mining process involves:

- Collecting transactions into a new block  
- Calculating a hash from the block’s content and a nonce  
- Testing different nonce values until a hash meeting the network’s difficulty is found  
- Validating and adding the block to the chain once a valid hash is discovered  

The goal of this process is to ensure the blockchain’s **security and immutability**, preventing data tampering and ensuring each block is securely linked to the previous one.

## **Rewards**

Miners receive:

- **Block reward**: Newly issued cryptocurrency from the network  
- **Transaction fees**: Voluntary payments included by users  

Example in Bitcoin:
- Initial reward: 50 BTC per block  
- Halved every 210,000 blocks (~every 4 years)  
- Current reward (2024): 6.25 BTC  

---

## **Mining Difficulty**

- The network automatically adjusts the difficulty level every set number of blocks (in Bitcoin, every 2016 blocks)  
- The goal is to maintain a constant block interval (e.g., 10 minutes in Bitcoin)  
- The more computational power the network has, the harder it becomes to find a valid block  

---

## **Energy Consumption and Criticism**

- PoW mining consumes large amounts of electricity  
- Environmental concerns have arisen due to its carbon footprint  
- Alternatives such as **Proof of Stake (PoS)** have been developed to reduce energy consumption  

---

## **Mining Pool**

Miners can collaborate by forming **pools**, where they combine computational power and share rewards proportionally, increasing their chances of success.

---

## **Visual Example of the Process**

```text
1. Collect transactions
2. Create a new block
3. Begin hash calculation
4. Test different nonce values
5. Find a valid hash
6. Add the block to the chain
7. Receive reward
```

## **Relation to Blockchain Security**

- Mining imposes an **economic cost** on altering the blockchain  
- An attacker would need to control more than 50% of the computational power to reorganize previous blocks (**51% attack**)  
- As long as mining is decentralized, it is extremely difficult to carry out a successful attack

## **What Are Wallets For?**

Cryptocurrency wallets don’t just store keys—they are powerful tools that let you interact with the entire blockchain ecosystem. From sending and receiving funds to accessing decentralized applications, their use goes far beyond simple transfers.

## **1. Sending and Receiving Cryptocurrencies**

The most basic and fundamental use:

-  **Send funds** anywhere in the world in seconds.  
-  **Receive payments** through your public address.

> Wallets enable transactions without intermediaries, directly, securely, and verifiably on the blockchain.

## **2. Storing Crypto Assets**

Beyond coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum, wallets can store other digital assets:

- **Tokens** (ERC-20, SPL, BEP-20, etc.)  
- **NFTs** (non-fungible tokens)  
- **Stablecoins** such as USDT, USDC, DAI

> Each asset is kept under your control, as long as you have access to your private key or seed phrase.

## **3. Accessing Decentralized Applications (dApps)**

With a wallet, you can connect to thousands of applications built on blockchains:

-  **DeFi**: Lending platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), yield farming.  
-  **NFTs**: Marketplaces like OpenSea, Magic Eden.  
-  **Web3 Games**: Play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity, Decentraland, The Sandbox.

Your wallet allows you to **authorize actions** in blockchain applications through digital signature:

- Approve a smart contract.  
- Accept a trade.  
- Vote in a DAO.

> Every time you interact with a dApp, you sign digitally to confirm your agreement.

## **5. Participating in ICOs, IDOs, and Airdrops**

Wallets are essential for:

- Investing in new projects during initial launches.  
- Participating in public token sales.  
- Receiving **airdrops** (free token rewards).

## **6. Interacting with Multiple Blockchain Networks**

Modern wallets like MetaMask, Phantom, or Trust Wallet allow you to work with multiple blockchains:

- Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.

> You can switch networks depending on the token or app you want to use.

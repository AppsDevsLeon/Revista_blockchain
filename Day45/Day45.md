## **Privacy Tools and VPN Recommendations**

## Introduction

In this chapter, I will recommend that you visit the **Privacy Tools** website. It is an excellent resource for finding various privacy tools. This website includes a range of recommended **VPNs**, such as **Mullvad**, which I personally recommend. You can pay for Mullvad with **Monero** or **Bitcoin** — the most convenient option being to use **Monero**.

While there are other VPNs listed, I don’t recommend using those too much since they are very popular and many countries have started banning them. For example, I encountered this issue during my travels, where some VPNs were blocked just because of their name, such as **NordVPN** or **ExpressVPN**.

Some countries impose strict VPN restrictions, so in those cases, the best approach is to create your own private VPN. This way, it cannot be detected or banned because it is only for your use on your private server.

I also recommend using **Mullvad**, as it is one of the best VPNs I have found for privacy.

## Private Browsers

In addition to VPNs, **Privacy Tools** also recommends private browsers. I strongly recommend avoiding **Google Chrome** as it is one of the worst browsers for privacy. Here are some better alternatives:

- **LibreWolf**: This is a fork of Mozilla Firefox, with all the privacy features and configurations enabled. It’s very good for privacy.
- **Brave**: One of the best browsers for privacy. I recommend it a lot.
- **Firefox Focus**: A great browser for mobile, offering privacy-focused features.
- **Tor**: This is the ultimate tool for privacy, but I only recommend using it in extreme cases where you need maximum anonymity. Make sure you connect it with your VPN first.
- **DuckDuckGo**: It also has a browser which is highly recommended.

## Email Privacy Tools

When it comes to emails, I suggest avoiding services like **Gmail** or **Hotmail**, as they track your activity and violate your privacy. Some good alternatives include:

- **ProtonMail**: A great privacy-focused email service.
- **Tutanota**: Another excellent alternative.
- **SimpleLogin**: This is a great tool for creating email aliases. It allows you to hide your real email and provide aliases for different services. You can create up to 10 aliases for free, and the paid version allows unlimited aliases. This way, if one alias gets hacked, your personal email remains safe.

## Password Managers

For managing your passwords securely, I recommend **Bitwarden**. It's an excellent password manager that allows you to generate unique passwords for each service. You only need to remember one master password, and Bitwarden will handle the rest. It works with browsers like Brave, and you can also use it on your mobile devices.

I plan to make an exclusive video on how to set up **Bitwarden** with **Umbrel** (a Bitcoin node) for self-hosting, which I use across several servers to store all my passwords. It’s an essential tool for maintaining privacy.

## Cloud Storage

When it comes to cloud storage, services like **Dropbox** may compromise your privacy. It is best to create your own personal cloud storage system. You can achieve this by setting up your own **NextCloud** server on **Umbrel**, a Bitcoin node. This gives you full control over your data, ensuring it’s not stored on a third-party service.

## Cryptocurrency Privacy

For cryptocurrency transactions, I recommend using **Bisq** for purchasing Bitcoin without needing to complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) process. Another good option is **OTC trading**, which I have discussed in a video on my channel.

## Private Messengers

When it comes to messaging, I recommend using services that prioritize privacy:

- **Session**: This uses a network called **Lokinet**, similar to Tor, to send messages securely. It’s an excellent choice for privacy.
- **Signal**: One of the best options for mobile messaging.
- **Other alternatives**: There are several other privacy-focused messaging services you can explore.

## File Encryption Tools

To ensure your files are securely encrypted, I recommend checking out tools like **Hashcat**, which is a great program for file encryption.

## Conclusion

I highly recommend the **Privacy Tools** website for anyone looking to improve their privacy. It offers a variety of tools and resources that can help you protect your online presence.

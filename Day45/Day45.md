## **Privacy Tools and VPN Recommendations** 


In this chapter, I will recommend that you visit the **Privacy Tools** website. It is an excellent resource for finding various privacy tools. This website includes a range of recommended **VPNs**, private browsers, email tools, password managers, and more.

Among the highlighted tools are **VPNs** like **Mullvad**, which I personally recommend. It also offers options to pay with **Monero** or **Bitcoin**, with **Monero** being the most convenient option. Below, you'll find a comparison of the best options for privacy and security technologies.

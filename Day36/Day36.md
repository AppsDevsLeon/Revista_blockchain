## **How Do Wallets Work?**

Understanding how wallets work is essential to navigating the world of cryptocurrencies safely and effectively. While they don’t actually store coins like a physical wallet, they **play a crucial role** in managing and securing your digital assets.

## **The Wallet as a Key Manager**

A crypto wallet doesn’t hold cryptocurrencies directly—it **manages cryptographic keys**. There are two types of keys involved:

- **Private Key**: Like a password, it gives full control over your funds.
- **Public Key**: Derived from the private key, it is used to generate your wallet address.

The **wallet address** (a shorter, readable version of the public key) is what you share with others to receive funds.

## **What Happens When You Send Crypto?**

When you send cryptocurrency to someone, here’s what actually happens under the hood:

1. You initiate the transaction from your wallet.
2. Your **private key** signs the transaction, proving it's really you.
3. The transaction is broadcasted to the blockchain network.
4. Validators (miners or stakers) confirm and add it to a new block.
5. The recipient’s address appears as the new owner of the funds.

> The funds didn’t "move" from one place to another—they simply **changed ownership** on the blockchain.

## **Wallet Types and How They Operate**

Wallets can be classified by how and where they store your private key:

### **Hot Wallets**
- Connected to the internet.
- Fast and convenient for daily use.
- Examples: Mobile apps, browser extensions (e.g., MetaMask).

###  **Cold Wallets**
- Offline storage of private keys.
- Ideal for long-term and secure storage.
- Examples: Hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor, or paper wallets.

## **Custodial vs Non-Custodial**

###  **Custodial Wallets**
- Your keys are managed by a third party (like an exchange).
- Easier for beginners, but less control.

###  **Non-Custodial Wallets**
- You hold and control your own private keys.
- More secure, but **you are fully responsible** for your access.

>  **Remember**: Not your keys, not your crypto.

## **Seed Phrase: Your Backup Plan**

Most wallets generate a **seed phrase** (usually 12 or 24 words) when you create them. This phrase can be used to recover your wallet if you lose access to your device.

- Store it **offline** and in a secure place.
- Never share it online or with anyone.

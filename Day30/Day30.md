# **Consensus Algorithms in Blockchain: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**

**Delegated Proof of Stake** (DPoS) is a variant of the **Proof of Stake (PoS)** consensus algorithm. Its primary innovation is the introduction of a **voting system** to elect transaction validators in a blockchain network.

Instead of selecting validator nodes solely based on the amount of staked cryptocurrency, **DPoS allows users to vote** for a set number of **delegates**. These delegates are responsible for:

-  Validating transactions  
-  Creating new blocks on the network

## **How Does It Work?**

1. ### **Staking**
   Users lock their cryptocurrencies in staking. This gives them **voting power proportional** to the amount staked.

2. ### **Voting**
   Users vote for **witnesses** — special nodes that are responsible for validating transactions and creating blocks.

3. ### **Validation and Rewards**
   The elected witnesses validate blocks and receive **rewards**, which can be shared with the voters who supported them.

4. ### **Witness Requirements**
   -  Reliable hardware  
   -  Excellent reputation  
   -  Active participation in the network

## **Advantages of DPoS**

-  **Higher Performance and Efficiency**  
  - Fewer validator nodes = faster transactions

-  **Democratization**  
  - Any user with tokens can participate by voting

-  **Security and Integrity**  
  - Rewards and reputation motivate validators to behave honestly

---

## **Disadvantages of DPoS**

-  **Tendency Toward Centralization**  
  - Only a limited number of nodes have validation power

## **Examples of Networks Using DPoS**

-  [Tron (TRX)](https://tron.network/)  
-  [EOS](https://eosnetwork.com/)

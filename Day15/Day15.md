### **Comparative Table**

| Characteristic           | Centralized                 | Decentralized                   | Distributed                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Point of Control**     | Single (centralized)        | Multiple (no total control)     | None (complete equality)    |
| **Fault Tolerance**      | Low (single point of failure)| Medium (some points of failure) | High (no single point of failure)|
| **Censorship**           | High possibility            | Low possibility                 | Extremely low possibility    |
| **Example**              | Traditional servers, banks  | Private blockchain, federated networks | Public blockchain, Bitcoin      |
| **Security**             | Moderate                    | High                           | Very high                   |

### **Detailed Explanation**

#### **Centralized Networks**
- **Control Point:** Single, centralized authority.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Low, as a single failure affects the entire system.
- **Advantages:** Easier to manage and faster decision-making.
- **Disadvantages:** High risk of failure, vulnerable to censorship and control by a single entity.

### **Decentralized Networks**
- **Control:** Multiple nodes with partial autonomy.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Moderate, as some nodes can fail without affecting the entire system.
- **Advantages:** Improved fault tolerance, reduced likelihood of censorship.
- **Disadvantages:** Possible centralization in certain nodes, less efficient scalability compared to distributed networks.

### **Distributed Networks**
- **Control:** No central control, nodes have equal roles.
- **Fault tolerance:** Very high, since the failure of individual nodes does not significantly affect the network.
- **Advantages:** High resistance to censorship, strong security, high scalability.
- **Disadvantages:** More complex coordination and management.
